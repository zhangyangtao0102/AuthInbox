**Auth Inbox** is an open-source project that securely receive and views authentication emails using [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/)'s free serverless services. It automatically processes incoming emails, extracts verification codes or links, and stores them in a database. A user-friendly web interface is provided for administrators to easily review the extracted information. AuthInbox also supports real-time notifications via Bark, making it a comprehensive and hassle-free solution for email authentication management.

Don't wanna receive ads and spams on your main email? Want a bunch of alternative email for register services and websites? Try this **secure**, **serverless**, **light** service!

## AI Prompt Optimization üß†

To ensure accurate extraction of information from incoming emails, we've implemented AI prompt optimization using the Google AI Studio API. By crafting precise and context-aware prompts, the AI can reliably identify and extract key elements such as:

- **Organization Name (Title)**: Identifies the sender's organization or company.
- **Verification Code/Link**: Extracts codes, links, or passwords necessary for account verification.
- **Email Topic**: Summarizes the main purpose of the email, such as 'account verification' or 'password reset'.

**Prompt:**
```plaintext
Email content: [Insert raw email content here].

Please read the email and extract the following information:
1. Code/Link/Password from the email (if available).
2. Organization name (title) from which the email is sent.
3. A brief summary of the email's topic (e.g., 'account verification').

Format the output as JSON with this structure:
{
  "title": "The organization or company that sent the verification code (e.g., 'Netflix')",
  "code": "The extracted verification code, link, or password (e.g., '123456' or 'https://example.com/verify?code=123456')",
  "topic": "A brief summary of the email's topic (e.g., 'account verification')",
  "codeExist": 1
}

If both a code and a link are present, include both in the 'code' field like this:
"code": "code, link"

If there is no code, clickable link, or this is an advertisement email, return:
{
  "codeExist": 0
}
```

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
0. **Prerequisites**

	- Create a [Google AI Studio API](https://aistudio.google.com/)

	- Bind a domain to your [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) account

	  - Get Your Cloudflare Account ID from [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile)

      - Generate a Cloudflare Workers API Token from [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)

	- (Optional) Download the [Bark App](https://bark.day.app/) and get a Bark Token from the App

1. **Install using Github Pages**

   1. **Creating D1 Database**

      1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) -> `Workers & Pages` -> `D1 SQL Database` -> `Create`

      2. Input Name `inbox-d1` and click `Create`

      3. After Creating `inbox-d1`, click in to it and find `Console`

      4. Execute the following SQL command from [db/schema.sql](https://github.com/TooonyChen/AuthInbox/blob/main/db/schema.sql) in the console, just copy, paste and execute it.

      5. Copy the `database_id` and `database_name` for the next step when you configure the `TOML` file

   2. **Deploy the Cloudflare Worker**

      [![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/TooonyChen/AuthInbox)

      1. Click the button on the top to fork this repository or directly fork this repository.

      2. Open the repository that you fork, find the `Actions` page, find `Deploy Auth Inbox to Cloudflare Workers`, and click `enable workflow` to activate the workflows.

      3. Then, in the repository page, navigate to `Settings` -> `Secrets and variables` -> `Actions` -> `Repository secrets` and add the following secrets:
         - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Cloudflare account ID.
         - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Cloudflare API Token.
         - `TOML`: Configuration file, refer to [wrangler.toml with comments](https://github.com/TooonyChen/AuthInbox/blob/main/wrangler.toml.example). **Please use the [version without comments](https://github.com/TooonyChen/AuthInbox/blob/main/wrangler.toml.example.clear) in adding the secret in case of unknown errors.**

      4. Back to `Action` Page in your repository, find `Deploy Auth Inbox to Cloudflare Workers` and press `Run workflow` to deploy the worker. If you can't find the `Run workflow` button, you can trigger GitHub Actions automatically by making a small edit to the `readme.md` file in your repository.

      5. After the deployment is successful, you can find the URL of your worker in the `Deploy Auth Inbox to Cloudflare Workers` workflow log.

      6. Find the `delete all logs` button in the upper-right corner of the workflow logs page. Delete the logs to avoid data leakage.

      7. Done! ‚úÖ Jump to step 3: Set Email Forwarding.


2. **Install using command-line**

	1. **Initialization**

		```bash
		npm install wrangler -g # install wrangler
		git clone https://github.com/TooonyChen/AuthInbox.git # clone the repository
		cd AuthInbox # change directory
		npm install # install dependencies
		```

	2. **create d1 database**

		When you execute the [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/) login command for the first time, you will be prompted to log in. Just follow the prompts.

		```bash
		npx wrangler d1 create inbox-d1 # creating a d1 database called 'inbox-d1'
		npx wrangler d1 execute inbox-d1 --remote --file=./db/schema.sql # write the schema.sql to the database
		```
		you will get the result like this:
		```bash
		‚úÖ Successfully created DB 'inbox-d1'

		[[d1_databases]]
		binding = "DB" # available in your Worker on env.DB
		database_name = "inbox-d1"
		database_id = "<unique-ID-for-your-database>"
		```
		please copy the result from your terminal, you will use them in the next step

	3. **Configure Environment Variables**

		Use `wrangler.toml` file in the project root with the necessary environment variables:

		```toml
		name = "auth-inbox"
		type = "typescript"

		[vars]
		UseBark = "true" # set 'true' to use or 'false' to not use
		barkUrl = "https://api.day.app"
		barkTokens = "[token1, token2]" # set to your bark tokens on your iOS device, download it from https://bark.day.app/, you can use multiple tokens, if you only use one, then set it to '[token1]'
		FrontEndAdminID = "admin" # your login
		FrontEndAdminPassword = "password" # your password
		GoogleAPIKey = "xxxxxxxxxxx" # your google api, go to https://aistudio.google.com/ to generate one if u dont have

		[[d1_databases]] # Copy the lines obtained from step 2 from your terminal.
		binding = "DB"
		database_name = "inbox-d1" # Copy from step 2
		database_id = "<unique-ID-for-your-database>" # Copy from step 2
		```

	4. **Deploy your own worker** üåê
	   Deploy your Worker to make your project accessible on the Internet. Run:
	   ```bash
	   npx wrangler deploy
	   ```
	   You will get output like this:
	   ```
	   Outputs: https://auth-inbox.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev
	   ```
	   You can now visit the URL for your newly depolyed Auth Inbox for checking the email results.
